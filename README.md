## reduce-perf-test

I wanted to test if a single .reduce is faster than a longer .filter-map-filter chain.

#### Run it yourself

I'm assuming you have Node installed on your system. Clone the repo then run `test.js` like so:

```
cd reduce-perf-test && node test.js
```

You will then see the results in the console.
